# Thanks for the test

I kept things very simple trying to solve only the basic things that you requested.

Because you mentioned that you are testing with the latest version of Google Chrome, I used Fetch for Ajax call to work faster.
For the CSS I was tempted to use SCSS preprocessor but I thought that you don't want that.
I'm using Autoprefixer as an extension for my editor and I let it do its job on the css file.
